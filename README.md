# StackOne API Postman Collection

Welcome to the StackOne API repository. This README provides information about the Postman collection generated by the Speakeasy tool for the StackOne API.

## About the Collection

The Postman collection included in this repository is designed to help developers interact with the StackOne API more effectively. It includes pre-configured requests for all the endpoints described in the StackOne API documentation.

## Using the Collection

To use the Postman collection, follow these steps:

1. Download and install Postman from [Postman's official site](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).
2. Import the `StackOne_postman_collection.json` file into Postman:
   - Open Postman.
   - Click on `File` > `Import`.
   - Choose the `StackOne_postman_collection.json` file from your local system.
3. Once imported, you can start making API calls directly from Postman using the pre-configured requests.

## Collection Details

- **Collection Name:** StackOne
- **Schema Version:** [Postman Collection Schema v2.1.0](https://schema.getpostman.com/json/collection/v2.1.0/collection.json)

## Automated Sync to Postman

This repository includes a GitHub workflow that automatically syncs the Postman collection to your Postman workspace when changes are merged to the main branch.

### Setup Requirements

To enable automatic synchronization, you need to configure the following GitHub secrets in your repository:

1. **`POSTMAN_API_KEY`**: Your Postman API key
   - Generate from: [Postman Account Settings](https://postman.co/settings/me/api-keys)
   - Required permissions: Collection management

2. **`POSTMAN_WORKSPACE_ID`**: Your Postman workspace ID
   - Find in Postman: Go to your workspace → Settings → Info → Workspace ID
   - Or via API: `GET https://api.getpostman.com/workspaces`

### How It Works

- The workflow triggers when changes to `StackOne_postman_collection.json` are pushed to the main branch or when a PR containing changes to this file is merged
- If a collection named "StackOne" exists in your workspace, it will be updated
- If no collection exists, a new one will be created
- The workflow uses the official Postman API for all operations
